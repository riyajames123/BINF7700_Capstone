# BINF7700 Capstone Project

## Overview
This repository will contain the capstone project for the course **BINF 7700**.  
The project will focus on applying bioinformatics concepts, computational analysis,
and reproducible research practices learned during the course.

## Project Status
Project topic under development
This repository is being used to plan, organize, and document the development of the
capstone project.

## Technical skills inventory
- Programming Languages: Python, R, Bash
- Bioinformatics: Sequence analysis, omics data analysis, gene expression analysis, RNA-Seq analysis, variant interpretation, pathway enrichment
- Computational Biology: Tumor mutation profiling, pharmacogenomics, protein docking, MD simulations
